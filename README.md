# non-hacker
Sample of engineering, TDD, solutions.

This project is a Software Engineerâ€™s approach to hacker questions.

After senior software engineering interviews I have often been asked to take online hacking tests.  Either the ambulatory compiler, API dictionary, or hack something that does X, Y, and Z, sort of non-engineering tests.  These differ greatly from the type of in-person, walk us through how you would develop sort of interaction.

I decided to create a repository with a sample of engineering, TDD, solutions.
