# non-hacker
This project is a Software Engineerâ€™s approach to software engineering questions.
I created it after some senior software engineering interviews included nonsense, like being asked to take online hacking tests or how to solve some old school code question.
I do not claim to be an ambulatory compiler or API dictionary and have no desire to limit myself in that way.
I decided to create a repository with a sample of engineering and TDD.
